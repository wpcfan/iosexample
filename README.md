# An Example iOS App

This is my first iOS app, and I want to integrate the following tech stack

1. RxSwift/RxCocoa: make our reactive
2. Layout: declarative layout, make iOS development web-ish
3. ReactorKit: introduce redux concept in iOS
4. NavigatorURL: abstract navigation and take it out of viewcontrollers
5. JLog: make logging available to remote just like local desktop
6. PINImage: make remote image easy
7. fastlane: the toolchain to ease testing/building/signing/publishing
